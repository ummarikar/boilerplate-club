## Boilerplate Club

This is a boilerplate SaaS web app with the following:
- Nextjs
- Supabase (auth + database)
- Resend
- Shadcn/ui
- Dark mode
- Stripe

This boilerplate is based off of [Vercel's Nextjs subscription payments template](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments/tree/main) and it also uses UI examples from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com). Most if not all the credit should go to them. I've just sprinkled a bit of my own stuff on top :\).

It has not been deployed to production before so I would keep that in mind when working with this boilerplate.
